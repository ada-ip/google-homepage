# Google Homepage Clone

This project consists of creating a clone of the google homepage using only HTML and CSS, so the search bar and buttons don't work.

## :mag: Why this project

I'm doing The Odin Project online bootcamp and this is their first suggested HTML and CSS project. The idea is to create an exact look alike of the google homepage practicing HTML and CSS.

## :book: What I learned doing this project

* Getting comfortable with flexbox, specially order and flex-grow properties.
* Working and positioning icons.
